A quickly python script to convert any picture in a “GameBoy” camera photo.
It has been done in barely 15 minutes, and gotten better in other 10 minutes, so it’s easily to be improved (mainly to skip the temporal file  step).

**Example**
<pre>
python cameragb.py IMG_4934.jpg
</pre>

Input:
![Picture](IMG_4934.jpg) {width: 200px;}

Output:
![Picture](GAMEBOYER.jpg)

Todo:
- Skip the temp.JPG step
- Choose among different sizes
